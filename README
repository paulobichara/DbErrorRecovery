Academic project from Database II class that simulates a database error 
recovery system, based in log generation, checkpoints and REDOs. You can 
create several transactions and resources and simulates transaction operations 
of: START, COMMIT, WRITE and READ, besides an error generator.

I'm submitting with the eclipse project structure, so, to run, just 
checkout the project folder into your eclipse's workspace, go to 
"Import -> Existing Project Into Workspace" and select its folder. The 
main class is Form.java.

Good luck!
